## VAT Calculator (BTW in dutch)
🔥 I was talking to a friend about the price of a certain laptop with & without VAT. For some reason we got different outcomes (he got it wrong, I was right 🤓). When googling for a decent calculator I noticed all (Belgian) calculators had very outdated styles, so I decided to make my own! VAT calculator app using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/).


### Stack

- Calculate price before VAT
- Sliders for VAT percent
- All values are editable and calculated instantly
- Dark mode
- Fast
- Mobile friendly
